                        Working in the internal audit assignments I came across many challenging volumnous data which required a lot of manually performance and consumed unnecessary hours of my time. I wanted the time for analysis rather than spending on manually going through excel and getting the information I need. With this curiosity I started exploring how can I use my skills in coding to get things done in my work resulting into saving my precious time that I could use to perform analysis and provide the management with useful information.

                        I am always excited to learn things by myself rather than depending on any companion. I will instantly think of learning a new thing and set my mind immediately to start with it. With this mindset, I have been able to learn how to perform equity research of the companies, I was able to learn how to code and still learning, I have been able to learn how to prepare a financial model of a company to take investment decisions, I have even learned to cook really good food. The continous hunger for knowledge is what keeps me energised to learn and implement things. My skills that I have honed for years to be able to perform research of anything I want have made it possible to reach beyond what I was at yesterday.

                        Ever since I was a kid, I have always been drawn towards computers. Growing up it has been always fascinating for me to see those beautiful yet useful softwares. I always wondered how do they even make it happen? Turning an idea into a reality! Coding is something that gives me the feeling of being able to develop something by myself. It gives me the power to build something of my own. This satisfaction is what makes me a lot happier when I code. I enjoy coding like it is a therapy for me to be at peace.
